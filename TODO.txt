To Do (as of 11/23/2020)

1) Populate DB with information via insert statements in the setup file
2) Write SQL queries for methods in dbUtils
    - Check if patient can receive visitors (no covid, no contact, visitor limit not reached)
    - Check if visitor can visit (3 screening questions all have False as the answer)
    - Add visitor to db
    - Add visit to db
    - select patient location given patient name
    - select avg screening speed of a screener
    - select num people let in by screener where canVisit == false and letIn = true
3) Implement methods in dbUtils using the new queries as a base
4) Make window methods spawn a popup box using the data from the dbUtil methods
    -visitorWindow already done as a test
5) (?) Remove question and visitor_has_answer tables from db? (it works fine without them)
6) (?) Nicer UI?? I don't care but if anyone thinks we need it we can do it
